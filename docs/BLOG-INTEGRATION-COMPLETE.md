## 🔄 Workflow Integration

Blog system integrates seamlessly with existing 5-phase workflow:

1. **Discuss** → Use `/blog brief` to clarify requirements
2. **Research** → Blog system auto-researches (8+ sources)
3. **Plan** → Use `/blog outline` for structure
4. **Execute** → Use `/blog write` for content generation
5. **Verify** → Use `/blog analyze` for quality check

**OR** use automated approach: `/blog write` handles all 5 phases internally.

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### For High Quality (90+ scores)
1. Use phased approach for complex topics
2. Review and edit AI-generated content
3. Add personal examples and insights
4. Target 10+ unique sources (vs 8 minimum)
5. Include FAQ section with stats
6. Use question-based headings
7. Add code examples with comments

### For Series Content
1. Define series in `_data/series.yml` first
2. Create parts sequentially (1, 2, 3...)
3. Reference previous parts in prerequisites
4. Keep consistent difficulty level
5. Link between parts in content

### For AI Detection Pass
1. Avoid trigger phrases ("delve", "leverage", "seamlessly")
2. Use contractions ("it's", "you'll")
3. Vary sentence lengths
4. Add personal voice ("I've found", "In my work")
5. Read aloud - does it sound natural?
