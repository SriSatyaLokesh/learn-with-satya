## 15. Agent System — Technical Specification

### 15.1 Technology Stack

| Component | Choice & Rationale |
|---|---|
| Language | Node.js (TypeScript recommended) — Anthropic SDK has excellent JS/TS support |
| AI Model | `claude-sonnet-4-6` — Best balance of speed, cost, and quality for content tasks |
| Agent Pattern | Sequential chain with structured JSON handoffs. No parallelism — preserves context quality. |
| Web Search | Claude's built-in `web_search` tool (`type: web_search_20250305`) for Research Agent |
| Image Search | Unsplash API (free tier) for image suggestions; Wikimedia API for attribution lookups |
| File I/O | Node.js `fs` module — Formatter Agent writes directly to `_posts/category/` directory |
| Environment | `dotenv` for API key management (`.env` file never committed to git) |
| Runner Interface | CLI: `node agents/run.js "your content idea here"` |

### 15.2 Orchestrator Agent

Receives the author's raw idea and produces a structured content brief passed to all subsequent agents.

**Input:** Free-text prompt from author via CLI

**Output schema:**
```json
{
  "topic": "Transformer Architecture in AI",
  "category": "ai",
  "is_series": true,
  "series_id": "ai-fundamentals",
  "part_number": 3,
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "target_audience": "developers with basic ML knowledge",
  "scope_notes": "Focus on self-attention and why it replaced RNNs",
  "word_count_target": 1200
}
```

**Behaviour:**
- Classifies category from the 7 defined options
- Detects if this is a series post or standalone
- Detects if a new series needs to be created or an existing one extended
- If classification confidence is low, outputs clarification questions before proceeding
- Max tokens: `500`

### 15.3 Research Agent

**Input:** Content brief JSON from Orchestrator

**Tools used:** `web_search` (performs 4–6 targeted searches)

**Search strategy:**
1. Recent tutorials/articles on the topic
2. Statistics and data points
3. Common misconceptions or pitfalls
4. Expert perspectives or case studies

**Output:**
```json
{
  "research_insights": [
    "Transformers process all tokens in parallel, unlike RNNs which are sequential",
    "The original 'Attention is All You Need' paper was published in 2017 by Google Brain",
    "Self-attention complexity is O(n²) in sequence length — a known limitation"
  ],
  "notable_statistics": [
    "GPT-4 is estimated to have ~1.8 trillion parameters",
    "BERT uses only the encoder; GPT uses only the decoder"
  ],
  "research_sources": [
    { "title": "Attention is All You Need", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" },
    { "title": "The Illustrated Transformer", "url": "https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/" }
  ],
  "content_gaps": "Most articles skip positional encoding intuition — good angle for this post"
}
```

**Max tokens:** `2000`

### 15.4 SEO & Strategy Agent

**Input:** Content brief + Research summary

**Responsibilities:**
- Title generation with primary keyword in first 60 characters
- Slug generation (kebab-case, max 60 characters)
- Meta description (140–160 characters, includes primary keyword)
- H2/H3 outline (5–8 sections)
- Primary keyword + 4–6 secondary keywords
- Suggested internal links to existing posts in same category
- 2–3 image search query suggestions for Unsplash

**SEO rules enforced:**
- Primary keyword in: title, first paragraph, at least one H2, and meta description
- No keyword stuffing (max density ~2%)
- Internal links to 2–3 related posts
- Slug must not contain stop words (the, a, and, etc.)

**Output schema:**
```json
{
  "title": "Transformer Architecture Explained: Self-Attention from Scratch",
  "slug": "transformer-architecture-explained",
  "meta_description": "Learn how transformer architecture works — self-attention, positional encoding, encoder-decoder structure, and why it replaced RNNs in modern AI.",
  "outline": [
    {
      "h2": "What Problem Did Transformers Solve?",
      "h3s": ["The RNN Bottleneck", "Why Sequential Processing Doesn't Scale"],
      "notes": "Hook readers with the problem before introducing the solution"
    },
    {
      "h2": "The Self-Attention Mechanism",
      "h3s": ["Queries, Keys, and Values", "Attention Score Calculation", "Multi-Head Attention"],
      "notes": "Include a visual diagram placeholder here"
    }
  ],
  "primary_keyword": "transformer architecture explained",
  "secondary_keywords": ["self-attention mechanism", "encoder decoder transformer", "BERT vs GPT", "positional encoding"],
  "internal_link_suggestions": [
    { "anchor": "neural network basics", "url": "/ai/neural-networks-explained/" }
  ],
  "image_queries": [
    "transformer neural network diagram",
    "self-attention mechanism visualization",
    "encoder decoder architecture"
  ]
}
```

**Max tokens:** `1500`

### 15.5 Writing Agent

**Input:** Content brief + Research summary + SEO blueprint

**Writing constraints:**
- Minimum 800 words for series posts; 600 words for standalone posts
- Active voice throughout
- Developer-friendly tone: conversational but technically precise
- No plagiarism — all content rewritten from research in original voice
- Include a "What's Next" section at the end of all series posts

**Image placeholder format used in body:**
```
{{ IMAGE: transformer diagram self-attention | caption: Diagram showing how queries, keys and values interact in self-attention | credit: unsplash }}
```

**Required sections for series posts:**
1. Introduction / hook
2. Body sections (following the H2/H3 outline from SEO Agent)
3. Key Takeaways (bulleted summary)
4. What's Next (link to next part in the series)

**Output:** Full Markdown body text (no front-matter — handled by Formatter Agent)

**Max tokens:** `4000`

### 15.6 Formatter Agent

**Input:** All prior agent outputs (brief, research, SEO blueprint, written body)

**Responsibilities:**
1. Assemble complete Jekyll front-matter from all collected data
2. Replace `{{ IMAGE: ... }}` placeholders with proper Markdown + attribution
3. Validate front-matter completeness against the field reference in Section 13.2
4. Verify series/part number consistency with `_data/series.yml`
5. Check word count meets minimum
6. Confirm primary keyword is present in title and `meta_description`
7. Confirm attribution is present for all non-local images
8. Determine output file path: `_posts/{category}/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md`
9. Write file to disk
10. Print console summary to author

**Image attribution format output:**
```markdown
![Diagram showing how queries, keys and values interact in self-attention](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xyz)
*Photo by Jane Smith on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/xyz) — Unsplash License*
```

**Max tokens:** `2000`

### 15.7 Agent Handoff — `AgentContext` Data Contract

All inter-agent handoffs use a single cumulative `AgentContext` object passed through the chain. Each agent reads from and appends to this object. It is also saved as a JSON sidecar file (`agents/output/{slug}.context.json`) for debugging.

```typescript
interface AgentContext {
  // Set by Orchestrator
  topic: string;
  category: string;
  is_series: boolean;
  series_id?: string;
  part_number?: number;
  difficulty: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced";
  target_audience: string;
  scope_notes: string;
  word_count_target: number;

  // Set by Research Agent
  research_insights: string[];
  notable_statistics: string[];
  research_sources: { title: string; url: string }[];
  content_gaps: string;

  // Set by SEO Agent
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  meta_description: string;
  outline: { h2: string; h3s: string[]; notes: string }[];
  primary_keyword: string;
  secondary_keywords: string[];
  internal_link_suggestions: { anchor: string; url: string }[];
  image_queries: string[];

  // Set by Writing Agent
  body_markdown: string;
  image_placeholders: { query: string; caption: string; credit: string }[];

  // Set by Formatter Agent
  final_frontmatter: string;
  final_filepath: string;
  validation_passed: boolean;
  validation_errors?: string[];
}
```

### 15.8 Agent Runner — CLI Interface

```bash
# Run the full pipeline
node agents/run.js "Write Part 3 of the AI Fundamentals series on Transformer Architecture"

# Run with explicit overrides
node agents/run.js "Standalone post on why developers should learn Docker" --category devops --difficulty beginner

# Dry run (skip file write, just print the output)
node agents/run.js "..." --dry-run
```

**`.env` file (never committed):**
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

## 16. Theme Selection & Customisation

### 16.1 Theme Comparison

| Theme | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Chirpy** ⭐ Recommended | Dark mode built-in, excellent TOC, reading time, categories, ideal for dev blogs | Less flexible for fully custom layouts |
| Minimal Mistakes | Highly configurable, large community, built-in category/tag pages | Heavier; more config upfront |
| Just the Docs | Great for documentation-style series | Less blog-like; better for pure docs |
| TeXt Theme | Clean, feature-rich, good for tech blogs | Smaller community |

> **Recommendation:** Use **Chirpy** for its out-of-the-box dark mode, built-in TOC, reading time display, and excellent category support. It requires minimal customisation to match Learn with Satya K requirements.

### 16.2 Custom Additions to Theme

The following custom components must be built on top of the chosen theme:

| Component | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Series Navigation | `_includes/series-nav.html` | Prev/Next buttons with part titles, injected below post content |
| Learning Path Sidebar | `_includes/series-sidebar.html` | Sticky list of all series parts with completion checkmarks |
| Difficulty Badge | `_includes/difficulty-badge.html` | Colour-coded badge (green/yellow/red) shown next to read time |
| Image Credit Block | `_includes/image-credit.html` | Renders the structured attribution block below each image |
| Progress Tracker | `assets/js/progress.js` | Marks posts as read in `localStorage` on scroll-to-bottom |
| Series Completion Bar | `assets/js/series-progress.js` | Calculates and renders series completion % on series index pages |
| JSON-LD Injection | `_includes/jsonld-article.html` | Schema.org Article structured data for SEO rich results |

## 17. GitHub Pages Deployment

### 17.1 Step-by-Step Deployment Flow

1. Developer runs the agent pipeline locally:
   ```bash
   node agents/run.js "Write Part 3 of AI Fundamentals on Transformers"
   ```
2. Formatter Agent writes the `.md` file to `_posts/ai/` and notifies the developer
3. Developer reviews the generated Markdown, makes any manual edits, places the hero image in `assets/images/posts/{slug}/hero.jpg`
4. Developer commits and pushes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(ai): add ai-fundamentals-part-3 transformer architecture"
   git push origin main
   ```
5. GitHub Actions workflow triggers Jekyll build
6. Site is live at `https://yourusername.github.io/Learn with Satya K/` within 1–3 minutes

### 17.2 GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy Jekyll to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

## 18. SEO Technical Implementation

### 18.1 Plugin Configuration

| Plugin | Configuration |
|---|---|
| `jekyll-seo-tag` | Reads `title`, `description`, `canonical_url`, and `header.image` from front-matter to auto-generate `<meta>` and OpenGraph tags |
| `jekyll-sitemap` | Auto-generates `/sitemap.xml` on build. Exclude pages via `sitemap: false` in front-matter. |
| `jekyll-feed` | Generates `/feed.xml` for all posts. Configure per-category feeds in `_config.yml`. |
| `jekyll-toc` | Scans H2/H3 elements in post body to generate sticky table of contents. Enabled via `toc: true` in front-matter. |

### 18.2 Schema.org JSON-LD

Each post page injects an `Article` schema JSON-LD block via `_includes/jsonld-article.html`:

```html
<!-- _includes/jsonld-article.html -->

## 19. Search Implementation

### 19.1 Lunr.js Client-Side Search

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| Index Generation | A Jekyll plugin generates `search.json` at build time containing: post title, excerpt, URL, category, tags, and part number for all posts |
| Index Loading | `search.js` fetches `/search.json` on page load and builds the Lunr index client-side |
| Search UI | Modal or slide-in panel triggered by `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` and search icon in nav |
| Results Display | Show post title, category badge, excerpt snippet, and series info (if applicable) |
| Performance | Search index is compressed; typically < 200KB for 500 posts |

### 19.2 `search.json` Generation (Jekyll Plugin)

```liquid
---
layout: null
---
[
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  {
    "title": {{ post.title | jsonify }},
    "excerpt": {{ post.excerpt | strip_html | truncatewords: 30 | jsonify }},
    "url": {{ post.url | jsonify }},
    "category": {{ post.category | jsonify }},
    "tags": {{ post.tags | jsonify }},
    "series": {{ post.series | jsonify }},
    "part": {{ post.part | jsonify }},
    "difficulty": {{ post.difficulty | jsonify }},
    "date": {{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" | jsonify }}
  }{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}
  {% endfor %}
]
```
