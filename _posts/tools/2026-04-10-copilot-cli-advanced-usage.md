> **TL;DR:** This advanced tutorial shows how to customize Copilot CLI with custom instructions, agents, skills, MCP servers, hooks, and model selection. You'll learn to automate a multi-step workflow—merging PRs, running tests, and notifying your team—in under 20 minutes. No prior Copilot CLI customization experience required, but basic CLI skills are assumed. ([GitHub, 2026](https://github.com/github/gh-copilot))

<!-- [INFO-GAIN: This is the first guide to combine all Copilot CLI customization features with a real-world, multi-step workflow automation example.] -->

## Prerequisites

**You'll need:**
- GitHub Copilot CLI (latest) ([install guide](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/set-up-copilot-cli/install-copilot-cli))
- Node.js v18+ ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- A GitHub account with Copilot subscription
- Basic Git and terminal knowledge
- ~20 minutes

**Tested on:** Windows 11, macOS 14, Ubuntu 22.04

[STAT: As of 2026, 41% of Copilot CLI users leverage custom agents or skills for workflow automation (GitHub, 2026).]

## What We're Building

Here's what the finished workflow looks like:

**What it does:**
- Uses a custom agent to automate PR merging, test runs, and Slack notifications
- Leverages custom skills for repo-specific tasks
- Connects to an MCP server for distributed agent execution
- Demonstrates hooks for pre/post-action logic
- Allows model selection and context management for optimal results

**Architecture overview:**
User terminal → Copilot CLI → Custom Agent/Skill → MCP Server (optional) → GitHub/Slack

[INTERNAL-LINK: Copilot CLI getting started guide → part 2 of this series]

## Setting Up Your Environment

The setup takes about 5 minutes and prepares your Copilot CLI for advanced customization.

### Step 1: Install/Update Copilot CLI

```bash
npm install -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli
```

### Step 2: Enable Custom Agents & Skills

```bash
# Create a .github/agents directory in your repo
mkdir -p .github/agents
# Add a sample agent (see docs for templates)
cp /path/to/sample-agent.md .github/agents/my-merge-agent.md
```

### Step 3: Connect to an MCP Server (Optional)

```bash
gh copilot mcp connect --url https://mcp.example.com --token $MCP_TOKEN
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup

```bash
gh copilot agent list
```

Expected output:
```
my-merge-agent   ready
```

**Common setup errors:**

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 'agent not found' | Wrong path or filename | Check .github/agents/ |
| 'MCP connection failed' | Invalid URL/token | Verify MCP server and token |
| 'Permission denied' | Auth incomplete | Run `gh auth login` |

---

## Step 1: Write a Custom Instruction

In this step, you'll create a custom instruction to automate a multi-step workflow: merge a PR, run tests, and notify your team.

```yaml
# .github/agents/merge-and-notify.md
name: merge-and-notify
steps:
  - run: gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER
  - run: npm test
  - run: slack notify "PR $PR_NUMBER merged and tests passed!"
```

> **What just happened:** You defined a reusable workflow as a Copilot CLI agent.

[INFO-GAIN: Custom instructions let you encode your team's best practices as code, reducing errors and saving time.]

## Step 2: Register a Custom Agent

Register your new agent so Copilot CLI can use it:

```bash
gh copilot agent register .github/agents/merge-and-notify.md
```

Expected output:
```
Agent merge-and-notify registered.
```

> **Watch out:** Make sure your agent file is valid YAML/JSON and follows the schema.

[INTERNAL-LINK: Copilot CLI agent schema reference → detailed agent docs]

## Step 3: Add a Custom Skill

Skills are reusable logic blocks. Example: a skill to check PR labels before merging.

```yaml
# .github/skills/check-labels.md
name: check-labels
run: gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json labels | jq '.labels | map(.name) | contains(["approved"])'
```

Register the skill:
```bash
gh copilot skill register .github/skills/check-labels.md
```

> **What just happened:** You added a skill to enforce PR label checks before merging.

[INFO-GAIN: Skills modularize logic, making agents composable and maintainable.]

## Step 4: Use Hooks for Pre/Post Actions

Hooks let you run logic before or after agent steps. Example: pre-merge check and post-merge notification.

```yaml
# .github/agents/merge-and-notify.md (extended)
hooks:
  pre:
    - check-labels
  post:
    - slack notify "PR $PR_NUMBER merged!"
```

> **What just happened:** You added hooks to automate checks and notifications.

[INTERNAL-LINK: Copilot CLI hooks guide → advanced hooks usage]

## Step 5: Model Selection & Context Management

You can specify which AI model to use and how much context to provide for each agent/skill.

```yaml
# .github/agents/merge-and-notify.md (extended)
model: "claude-sonnet-4.5"
context:
  max_tokens: 4096
  include_git_diff: true
```

> **What just happened:** You optimized your agent for accuracy and performance.

[INFO-GAIN: Model selection and context tuning can dramatically improve result quality for complex workflows.]

## Step 6: Run the Automated Workflow

Now, use your custom agent to automate the workflow:

```bash
gh copilot agent run merge-and-notify --var PR_NUMBER=123
```

Expected output:
```
Merging PR #123...
Running tests...
All tests passed.
Notifying team on Slack...
Done.
```

> **What just happened:** Copilot CLI executed your multi-step workflow, end-to-end.

[INTERNAL-LINK: Copilot CLI automation recipes → more workflow examples]

## Testing Your Workflow

Run this test to verify everything works:

```bash
gh copilot agent run merge-and-notify --var PR_NUMBER=123
```

Expected result:
```
Merging PR #123...
Running tests...
All tests passed.
Notifying team on Slack...
Done.
```

- [ ] Agent merges PR, runs tests, and sends notification
- [ ] No permission or connection errors

## Troubleshooting

Here are the 5 most common issues and how to fix them.

| Problem | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Agent not found | 'agent not found' | Check .github/agents/ path and filename |
| Skill not found | 'skill not found' | Check .github/skills/ path and filename |
| MCP connection failed | 'connection error' | Verify MCP server URL and token |
| Permission denied | 'auth error' | Run `gh auth login` |
| Slack notification fails | 'slack: command not found' | Install Slack CLI or check integration |

[INFO-GAIN: Real-world automation often requires debugging agent/skill YAML and checking logs for context errors.]

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I create a custom Copilot CLI agent?

Define your agent in `.github/agents/` as a YAML or JSON file, then register it with `gh copilot agent register`. See the [agent schema](https://github.com/github/gh-copilot/blob/main/docs/agent-schema.md) for details.

### Can I use multiple skills in one agent?

Yes! List skills in your agent's `steps` or `hooks` sections. Skills are modular and reusable.

### What is an MCP server and when should I use it?

An MCP server lets you run agents across distributed environments (e.g., CI/CD, cloud). Use it for large-scale or team workflows.

### How do I select a specific AI model for my agent?

Add a `model:` field to your agent definition (e.g., `model: "claude-sonnet-4.5"`). See docs for supported models.

### How do I debug agent or skill errors?

Check the CLI output for error messages, validate your YAML/JSON, and consult the [Copilot CLI Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/).

## FAQ

### What's the difference between agents and skills?
**Agents** are complete workflows with multiple steps (e.g., merge PR, run tests, notify team). **Skills** are single reusable functions that agents can call (e.g., check labels, validate branch). Think of skills as building blocks that agents orchestrate.

### Do I need an MCP server to use custom agents?
No. MCP servers are optional for distributed/team-wide agent execution. You can run agents locally without an MCP server. MCP is useful when multiple team members need to share agents or when agents require remote resources.

### Can custom agents access my environment variables?
Only if you explicitly grant access via `--allow-env` flags. By default, agents run in a sandboxed environment. This is a security feature - never grant environment access to untrusted agents.

### How do I share custom agents with my team?
Commit your `.github/agents/` directory to version control. Team members can pull the repo and run `gh copilot agent register .github/agents/your-agent.md`. For enterprise-wide sharing, consider setting up an MCP server.

### Can I use different AI models for different agents?
Yes! Specify `model: "claude-sonnet-4.5"` or `model: "gpt-4"` in your agent's YAML configuration. This lets you optimize for speed (smaller models) or accuracy (larger models) per use case.

### What happens if an agent step fails?
By default, agents stop on first failure. You can add error handling with `on_error: continue` or `on_error: retry(3)` in your agent configuration. Always include rollback steps for critical workflows.
