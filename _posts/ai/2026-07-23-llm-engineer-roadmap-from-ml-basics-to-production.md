## Why This Roadmap?

If you're a career switcher with Python experience and basic ML knowledge (regression, classification), but you want to become a **Conversational AI Engineer or LLM Engineer**—not an ML researcher—this path is intentionally designed for you.

This isn't a generic "top 10 AI courses" list. This is an **exact course sequence** with official course pages, built on the principle that your goal is production deployment, not academic research. Each stage flows into the next, eliminating duplicate content and building practical skills alongside theory.

**Assumption**: You already know Python and basic ML fundamentals. You want to work with language models, conversational AI, and production inference—not train models from scratch on research clusters.

---

## The 7-Stage Pathway

### Stage 0 — Deep Learning Foundation (Optional, but Recommended)

#### 1. MIT 6.S191 – Introduction to Deep Learning
**Duration**: 2–3 weeks | **Effort**: Medium

**Official course**: [MIT 6.S191](https://introtodeeplearning.com/) | **YouTube**: [MIT 6.S191 Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II4giR4vOOo&list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI&index=1)

**Why first?**

Modern deep learning explained exceptionally well by Alexander Amini. Covers neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, transformers, generative AI, and diffusion—everything you need for the rest of the roadmap in one coherent view.

This is **enough deep learning** for LLM engineering. You don't need a 6-month deep dive into backpropagation mathematics; you need to understand what transformers do and why they matter.

**What you'll learn**:
- Neural network fundamentals and backpropagation
- Convolutional and recurrent architectures
- Attention mechanisms (foundation for everything later)
- Generative models and diffusion
- Practical PyTorch implementation

**Next**: Move to conversational AI in Stage 1.

---

### Stage 1 — Conversational AI

#### 2. Stanford CS224U – Natural Language Understanding (Spring 2023)
**Duration**: 4–6 weeks | **Effort**: High

**Official course page**: [CS224U (Spring 2023)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/) | **YouTube**: [CS224U Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rObpMCir6rNNVWO0BrXLyPY)

**Why conversational AI first?**

Because this is your actual job title. Before learning transformers and LLMs, understand the conversation layer: what you're trying to achieve with language models.

**What you'll learn**:
- Intent detection and slot filling
- Dialogue systems and state management
- Semantic parsing and representations
- Conversation modeling (context, coherence, turn-taking)
- Grounding language in knowledge

**Key takeaway**: By the end, you'll understand *why* conversational systems need specific structures—knowledge this informs every LLM architecture choice later.

**Project idea**: Build an intent classifier for a simple dialogue system.

**Next**: Move to modern NLP and transformers in Stage 2.

---

### Stage 2 — NLP + Modern LLMs

#### 3. Stanford CS224N – Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (Spring 2024/Latest)
**Duration**: 6–8 weeks | **Effort**: High

**Official course**: [CS224N](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html) | **YouTube**: [CS224N Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOSH06i6q6bNTtErab5AVRJ)

**Why this course?**

This is THE modern NLP course. Unlike older versions, the current syllabus includes:
- **Transformers** (attention is all you need)
- **Scaling laws** (why bigger models are better)
- **RLHF** (how LLMs are actually trained)
- **PEFT** (parameter-efficient fine-tuning—the real skill for practitioners)
- **Agents** (autonomous reasoning systems)
- **RAG** (retrieval-augmented generation for grounded answers)

Don't skip these lectures. This is not theoretical deep learning—it's the engineering that powers production LLMs.

**What you'll learn**:
- Word embeddings and contextual representations
- Transformer architecture (self-attention, multi-head attention, position encoding)
- Pre-training and transfer learning
- Fine-tuning and parameter-efficient methods
- Reasoning, agents, and structured generation
- RAG and knowledge integration

**Assignments**: Hands-on PyTorch assignments that build up to a transformer implementation.

**Project idea**: Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on your own data using PEFT.

**Next**: Deep dive into transformer architecture and research perspectives in Stage 3.

---

### Stage 3 — Transformers and Frontier Research

#### 4. Stanford CS25 – Transformers United
**Duration**: 8–10 weeks | **Effort**: Medium (Seminar Series)

**Official course**: [CS25: Transformers United](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs25/past/cs25-v4/index.html) | **YouTube**: [CS25 Seminars](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNzJZvovUCH5t56UZA7-Rnw)

**What is this?**

This isn't a traditional lecture course—it's a seminar series of talks from researchers at OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, NVIDIA, and others.

This is how you hear directly from the people building frontier models. Topics include scaling laws, mixture-of-experts, multi-modal transformers, inference optimization, and emerging capabilities.

**Why it matters**: You need to understand not just how transformers work, but where they're heading. This course is your window into ongoing research without a PhD.

**What you'll learn**:
- Frontier transformer architectures
- Scaling laws and training dynamics
- Multi-modal models (vision + language)
- Inference optimization at scale
- Emerging capabilities (in-context learning, chain-of-thought)
- Real production systems and lessons learned

**Next**: Apply theory to production systems in Stage 4.

---

### Stage 4 — Production AI

#### 5. Full Stack Deep Learning
**Duration**: 4–6 weeks | **Effort**: High

**Official course**: [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/)

**Why?**

Theory meets engineering. This is where you learn the **systems thinking** required to ship LLM applications.

**What you'll learn**:
- **RAG systems** (data pipelines, vector databases, reranking)
- **LLMOps** (monitoring, versioning, experiment tracking)
- **Evaluation** (how to measure if your LLM is actually better)
- **Agents** (autonomous systems that reason and take actions)
- **Deployment architectures** (batching, serving, scaling)
- **Production monitoring** (drift, failures, feedback loops)

This is not a "take this course" recommendation—this is essential. The gap between a working notebook and a production system is where most LLM projects fail.

**Project idea**: Build a production RAG system with monitoring and evaluation metrics.

**Next**: Learn the most practical library ecosystem in Stage 5.

---

### Stage 5 — Hugging Face (The Standard Library)

#### 6. Hugging Face Learn
**Duration**: 3–4 weeks | **Effort**: Medium

**Official course**: [Hugging Face Learn](https://huggingface.co/learn)

**Why Hugging Face?**

It's the standard library for NLP and LLMs in production. If you don't know Hugging Face, you can't work in this field practically.

**What you'll learn**:
- **Transformers library** (loading models, tokenization, inference)
- **Tokenizers** (subword tokenization, special tokens, edge cases)
- **Fine-tuning** (full and parameter-efficient)
- **Datasets** (loading, processing, streaming large data)
- **Trainer API** (training loops, distributed training)
- **PEFT integration** (LoRA, QLoRA, efficient fine-tuning)

Complete every chapter. This is hands-on, applied learning.

**Project idea**: Fine-tune a model on a custom dataset using the Trainer.

**Next**: Deep technical dives into how transformers actually work in Stage 6.

---

### Stage 6 — Advanced LLM Engineering (DeepLearning.AI)

Take these in order. Each builds on the prior.

#### 7. How Transformer LLMs Work
**Duration**: 2–3 weeks | **Effort**: Low-Medium

**Official course**: [How Transformer LLMs Work](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/how-transformer-llms-work/information)

**Instructors**: Jay Alammar, Maarten Grootendorst

**Why?**

One of the best visual explanations of transformer internals. After 6 courses, you need to see the mechanics deeply explained.

**What you'll learn**:
- Attention heads and their specialization
- Token embeddings and positional encodings
- Layer-by-layer transformer behavior
- Attention patterns and information flow
- Why transformers work the way they do

---

#### 8. Pretraining LLMs
**Duration**: 2–3 weeks | **Effort**: Medium

**Official course**: [Pretraining LLMs](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/pretraining-llms)

**Why?**

You'll learn the full pipeline: dataset creation, tokenization, optimization, and evaluation at scale. Understanding pre-training is how you reason about model capabilities.

**What you'll learn**:
- Dataset creation and curation
- Tokenization strategies and tradeoffs
- Pre-training objectives and loss functions
- Training efficiency and hardware optimization
- Model initialization and scaling laws
- Evaluation during training

**Key insight**: You don't need to pre-train models yourself, but understanding the process unlocks better fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment decisions.

---

#### 9. Build and Train an LLM with JAX
**Duration**: 2–3 weeks | **Effort**: Medium-High

**Official course**: [Build and Train an LLM with JAX](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/build-and-train-an-llm-with-jax)

**Why JAX?**

You'll build a GPT-style model from scratch using JAX, a modern framework for numerical computing. This isn't about becoming a JAX expert—it's about truly understanding transformer architecture by implementing it.

**What you'll learn**:
- Implementing attention mechanisms
- Building tokenizers and embeddings
- Training loops and optimization
- Evaluation and inference
- Model architecture decisions and tradeoffs

**Practical value**: After this, reading transformer papers becomes a lot clearer.

---

#### 10. Fast & Efficient LLM Inference with vLLM
**Duration**: 2–3 weeks | **Effort**: Low-Medium

**Official course**: [DeepLearning.AI Short Courses Catalog](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/)

**Topics**:
- **KV Cache** (reducing memory in generation)
- **Continuous batching** (maxing throughput)
- **Tensor parallelism** (splitting models across GPUs)
- **Production inference** (quantization, speculative decoding)

**Why?** 

If you deploy LLMs, inference cost is 90% of your operational budget. This course teaches you the techniques used by vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, and other production inference engines.

---

#### 11. AI Agents
**Duration**: 2–3 weeks | **Effort**: Low

## The Compressed "10 Most Valuable" Roadmap

If you only have 6–9 months, here are the 10 courses that give you the most leverage:

1. **MIT 6.S191** – Introduction to Deep Learning
2. **Stanford CS224U** – Natural Language Understanding
3. **Stanford CS224N** – NLP with Deep Learning (current version)
4. **Stanford CS25** – Transformers United
5. **Full Stack Deep Learning** – Production systems
6. **Hugging Face Learn** – Practical library skills
7. **How Transformer LLMs Work** – Visual deep dive
8. **Pretraining LLMs** – Foundation understanding
9. **Build and Train an LLM with JAX** – Implementation
10. **Fast & Efficient LLM Inference with vLLM** – Production deployment

This path is achievable in 6–9 months if you're focused.

---

## The Project-Paired Learning Approach

Here's the secret that turns certificates into a portfolio:

Don't finish all 10 courses before building. **Pair each major course with a project:**

- **After CS224U** → Build an intent classifier or conversational dialogue pipeline
- **After CS224N** → Build a transformer-based NLP application (sentiment analysis, summarization, etc.)
- **After Full Stack Deep Learning** → Build a production-ready RAG system
- **After the JAX course** → Train a small GPT model on a custom dataset
- **After vLLM course** → Deploy your model with optimized inference

**Why?** Learning sticks when you apply it. Job interviews care about projects, not certificates. A portfolio of 4–5 well-executed projects is worth more than 14 course certificates alone.

## Timeline and Pacing

| Stage | Duration | Total Hours | Cumulative Time |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Stage 0 (Deep Learning) | 2–3 weeks | 30–40 | 2–3 weeks |
| Stage 1 (Conv. AI) | 4–6 weeks | 40–60 | 6–9 weeks |
| Stage 2 (NLP + LLMs) | 6–8 weeks | 60–80 | 12–17 weeks |
| Stage 3 (Transformers) | 8–10 weeks | 40–60 | 20–27 weeks |
| Stage 4 (Production) | 4–6 weeks | 40–60 | 24–33 weeks |
| Stage 5 (Hugging Face) | 3–4 weeks | 30–40 | 27–37 weeks |
| Stage 6 (Advanced DeepLearning.AI) | 15–18 weeks | 40–50 | 42–55 weeks |
| **Total** | — | **280–390 hours** | **9–14 months** |

**With projects in parallel**: 6–9 months minimum. Heavy commitment = 6 months. Leisurely = 14 months.

## How This Roadmap Is Different

**What you're NOT doing**:
- ❌ Watching random YouTube tutorials (inconsistent depth, outdated)
- ❌ Reading papers without foundation (premature and frustrating)
- ❌ Taking courses from random "AI educators" (hit or miss quality)
- ❌ Learning multiple competing libraries (you'll use Hugging Face, period)
- ❌ Chasing trends (focus on fundamentals, trends are noise)

**What you ARE doing**:
- ✅ Following official university courses (Stanford, MIT)
- ✅ Learning from researchers at OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind
- ✅ Building practical projects alongside theory
- ✅ Mastering one ecosystem (Hugging Face)
- ✅ Focusing on production engineering (the actual job)

---

## The Outcome

After this roadmap, you will:

- Understand transformer architecture at the implementation level (not just conceptually)
- Know how to fine-tune, deploy, and optimize LLMs for production
- Have built 4–5 production-quality projects
- Understand conversational AI systems end-to-end
- Know how to evaluate, monitor, and improve LLM systems
- Be job-ready for LLM Engineer or AI Engineer roles at startups, scale-ups, and enterprises

You won't be a researcher. You won't publish papers. **You'll be an engineer who can ship.**

---

## Start Now

Pick Stage 0 if you need deep learning basics. Otherwise, start with Stage 1 (CS224U).

The best time to start was a year ago. The second best time is today.

**Next step:** Go to [CS224U](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/) or [MIT 6.S191](https://introtodeeplearning.com/) and enroll.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **This is a path**, not a menu. Do courses in order.
- **Theory + Projects = Portfolio**. Don't finish courses without building.
- **Production engineering matters more than research**. CS25 is about research trends, Full Stack DL is about shipping systems.
- **Hugging Face is the standard library**. Master it.
- **You can compress this to 6–9 months** with sustained focus.
- **The next stage of your career starts now.**
